# JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to take create a password generator that meets the following criteria:

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Description
We were given a starter code for the password generator that included complete HTML and CSS files for the generator, as well as a starter code for the script.js file that had some basic functions and commentary written out. I then built the rest of the JS file to meet the criteria listed above. Detailed commentary can be found within the script.js file.
